    CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.MERGE, CascadeType.REMOVE, CascadeType.REFRESH, CascadeType.DETACH

    FetchType.LAZY is generally preferred for performance reasons, especially if the related entities are not always needed.
    Ex: Certificates will not be loaded until student.getCertificates() is called.

    FetchType.EAGER can be used if you want to load the related entities immediately when the parent entity is loaded.

    If you want to make Student the owner of the relationship, you would need to add a @JoinColumn annotation in the Certificate entity to specify the foreign key column.
